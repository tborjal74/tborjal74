## Introduction  

I'm a graduating student at BYU-Idaho pursuing a Bachelor's Degreee in Software Development. I love learning new things and understanding how systems work. The goal that drives me to become a expert software engineer is to build solutions that will help small/large businesses and organizations grow.

I get more excited to work with a team because that's another opportunity to learn again and build something unique and creative. For my personal project that I'm working on, I look forward to build a comprehensive ordering site for my wife's business that sells dumplings. I find it a great privilege to learn how to code and build software that drives people's business forward. I dream to establish my own team and company someday that provides software products and services to thriving business and even to large corporations. 

I'm also interested in working for projects that need developers, quality testers, and leadership roles.
